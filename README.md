A data management program written for a friend of mine. One can use it to import, export, view, modify, and sort SCA membership and attendance data.

Click on a column header to sort by that column.
Type in the field above the table to search it.

Selecting a row from the table will auto-fill its data into the corresponding text fields above.
The button options allow one to do general operations involving entire tables. Hover over a button to get more information about what it does.

The individual text fields allow one to do operations involving specific entries. Select the desired operation from the first drop down menu and specify the table(s) with the second. Execute the operation by pressing the button to the right of the text fields. For more information about what the currently selected combination of drop down options will do hover over the little green question mark.

Elements respond dynamically to the current drop down options.
